# The Odin Project - Google Homepage

## Goal

To deconstruct the Google homepage and rebuild it.

## Simple Page Element Observations

- CSS Grid is not used.
- Google logo is an image.
- Search box has limited scaling with window size (defined min and max size).
- No text or image scaling with window size, only whitespace.
- Links underline on hover, buttons and boxes shadow.
- Hamburger menu and Google profile logos can be recreated with CSS.
- Hamburger menu drops down to a fixed box with Google Apps (scrolls).
- Footer stacks vertically when squeezed. *Carbon neutral* goes to top, left elements next, and then right elements.
